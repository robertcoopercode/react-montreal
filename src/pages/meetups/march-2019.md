    presentationTitle: Bringing the WWW to the AAA
    text: >-
      Nowadays most developers are familiar with making single-page
      applications, which will adapt to desktop and mobile devices. But not all
      of them had to deal with TV screens and gamepad based controls. The goal
      of this talk is to explain how the React ecosystem is helping us at
      Ubisoft Club to build a solid user experience for our worldwide AAA users.
