    presentationTitle: Better UX and performance with React Suspense
    text: >-
      Suspense is one of the best new React API that will solve real user
      problems.


      React Suspense already allows easier code-splitting through components'
      lazy loading. In the near future, it will also offer better handling of
      the different loading states (spinners, placeholders...) in our apps. And
      soon comes Suspense for data loading!


      In this talk, we'll go over the problems solved with the Suspense API
      through a live-coding and see how we can incrementally adopt it in a demo
      app.
