    presentationTitle: Crash course with React Hooks
    text: >-
      React Hooks are a recently approved feature in React that allows you to
      completely forgo classes and build an entire application with functional
      components only. They are officially coming to a Q1 minor release of React
      (aka very soon), so learning how to use them is going to be useful to you
      and your team sooner rather than later. In this talk, Kenza will go in
      depth into Hooks, what problems they solve, and will share some important
      considerations and tips/tricks you need to know to get started.
