    presentationTitle: Let’s Simplify Your Complex Forms
    text: >-
      If you’ve built an app with React or React Native, chances are you’ve had
      to build at least one form. From profile screens to login pages, forms are
      unavoidable, and let’s be honest, they’re not very fun to build. For each
      field, you need to hold the value in the state of your component,
      implement onChange and onBlur handlers, implement validation… that makes
      for a lot of boilerplate, and that’s just for simple inputs.


      There are several libraries out there that attempt to simplify this
      process, from Redux Form, to React Form, to Formik, among others. In this
      talk, we’ll go over the existing solutions, how they stack up against each
      other, and what their limitations are.
