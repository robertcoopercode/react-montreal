    presentationTitle: The heart has its reason(ML)
    text: >-
      ReasonML is not a new language; it’s a new syntax powered by OCaml, and
      that is Javascript developer’s friendly.

      Going from JavaScript to ReasonML does not seem like an easy way to go;
      but building a React application with ReasonML becomes more and more
      accessible.

      I will explain the basic principles of ReasonML, demystify it through a
      live coding and present the benefits as well as the difficulties we
      encountered while using it.
